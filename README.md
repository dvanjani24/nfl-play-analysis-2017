# R Shiny App: NFL Offensive Performance and Play Selection

In 36-315 Statistical Graphics and Visualizations (undergraduate course at CMU), I learned how to use powerful packages in R like ggplot2 to build data visualizations and effectively communicate statistical interpretations. Through my final project for the course, I applied my knowledge to my passion for football. Namely, my project team and I built an interactive Shiny app that analyzes 2017 NFL play-by-play data to examine offensive performance and play selection, enabling users to make inferences on successful play strategies.
